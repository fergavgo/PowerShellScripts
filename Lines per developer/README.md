# Lines per developer in Git Repository
This little script finds out how many lines has written every developer in a Git project. 
Azure DevOps does not have Analitycs applied to Repos. In order to find out how many lines has a developer written, this script downloads the repositories you choose and analyze the amount of lines per developer.
Use the CSV files to indicate the repositories, branches and developers you want to scan.
The date range as well the files you want to use can be modified inside the PS1 file.
